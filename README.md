🚀 Features
🔎 URL feature extraction (length, presence of IP, suspicious characters, etc.)

🤖 Trained using machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.

📊 High accuracy in detecting phishing vs. legitimate websites

🧪 Supports testing with live and sample URLs

🌐 Simple user interface (optional: add Streamlit or Flask web app)

📁 Dataset: Phishing and legitimate URLs used for training and testing

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

(Optional) Streamlit or Flask for web app

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

📂 Dataset Used
Phishing Dataset from Kaggle or PhishTank (link to your dataset source)

⚙️ How It Works
Extract features from input URLs.

Preprocess data and train ML models.

Predict if the URL is phishing or legitimate.

(Optional) Use web interface to test live URLs.
